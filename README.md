# Networked Connect 4
My networked Java implementation of the popular game, Connect 4

# Installation/run instructions:
After downloading the source folder, navigate to it in a terminal. Then, in the terminal, compile the "Board.java", "Game.java", "GameServer.java" and "GUI.java" files, by typing "javac *.java", without the quotation marks. Afterwards, still in the terminal, start the server by typing "START /B java GameServer". To then run the two instances of the game with their respective GUIs, you can type "START /B java GUI" twice. Now you're able to play on the two instances and they will communicate using the server!
